# After Hours Gaming League (AHGL) - Static Website

This repository contains the source code for a static promotional and informational website I built for the After Hours Gaming League (AHGL).

## Project Context ("The Scene")

The After Hours Gaming League was a well-known corporate esports league where tech companies (like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Twitch) formed teams to compete in games like StarCraft 2 and League of Legends.

This project was a direct, hands-on application of the full-stack development skills I learned during my "career pivot" phase at the Coding Dojo (2013). The goal was to create a clean, responsive, and professional "front-door" for the league to attract new teams and provide information to players.

## My Role & Contributions

As the sole developer for this static site, I was responsible for:

*Translating design mockups into responsive HTML5 and CSS3.  
*Implementing and customizing JavaScript libraries (like jQuery, bxslider, and touchTouch) to create an interactive user experience.  
*Integrating the Bootstrap framework to ensure the layout was responsive and mobile-friendly.  
*Structuring the site architecture, navigation, and content for clarity and ease of use.  

## Technology Stack

This site was built using the standard web technologies of the time, demonstrating foundational "full-stack" knowledge:

*HTML5  
*CSS3 (including custom stylesheets and the Bootstrap framework)  
*JavaScript  
*jQuery (for DOM manipulation, effects, and plugins)  
*bxslider.js (for the homepage image slider)  
*touchTouch.jquery.js (for the image gallery functionality)
